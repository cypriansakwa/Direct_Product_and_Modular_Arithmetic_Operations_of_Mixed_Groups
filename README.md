This Rust program illustrates operations on the direct product of the additive group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$. The program generates elements of the direct product $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$, computes modular multiplication, and finds modular inverses. These operations are important in fields like cryptography, where groups like $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$ are frequently employed in algorithms and protocols.
