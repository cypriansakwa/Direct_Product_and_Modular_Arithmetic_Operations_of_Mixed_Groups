This Rust code demonstrates operations on the direct product of the additive group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$. The program creates elements for the direct product $\mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m$, computes modular multiplication, and determines modular inverses. These operations are significant in disciplines like cryptography, where groups like $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$ are commonly used in algorithms and protocols.
