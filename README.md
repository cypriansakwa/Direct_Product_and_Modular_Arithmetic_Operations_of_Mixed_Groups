This Rust code shows operations on the direct product of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the group of units $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$. It offers capability for generating elements of these groups, performing modular arithmetic on their direct product, calculating element products, and determining an element's inverse.

## Features
- **Generate Elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m$:** Create all elements in the direct product of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the group of units $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$.
- **Modular Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Element Product: Compute the product of two elements in the direct product group, with results modulo $n$ and $m$.
   - Element Inversion: Find the inverse of an element in the direct product group.
